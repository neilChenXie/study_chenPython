Fundamental
-----------------
* `#` for comment
*  `%` for `print`
    * What is the difference between `%r` and `%s` ?
        * Use the %r for debugging, since it displays the "raw" data of the variable, but the others are used for displaying to users.
    * What's the point of %s and %d when you can just use %r?
        * The %r is best for debugging, and the other formats are for actually displaying variables to users.
* `[]`, `{}` and `()`
    * `[]`: list
    * `{}`: dictionary
    * `()`: tuple
